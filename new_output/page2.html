	<span id="post-title"><h2>Post #4. Foldex</h2></span>
	<p>The Foldex cat, also known as the Exotic Fold, is a cat breed developed in the Canadian province of Quebec by crossbreeding a Scottish Fold and an Exotic Shorthair.<br></p><img src="/home/charles/Python/static_site_generator/doc/example_source_files/cats/foldex.jpg"><p><br>Foldexes are medium-sized cats with a rounded face, short legs, and sometimes folded ears; while the latter are intended to be the defining feature of the breed, only about 50% of them exhibit it. The eyes are rounded, the ears small, and the body stout like that of Scottish Fold, with a short face between those of the two originating breeds. The coat may be of any length, colour, and pattern.<br></p>
