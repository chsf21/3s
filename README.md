A lightweight Python script for generating static websites from textfiles and "templates" written in HTML. Great for blogs, news, webcomics, and more.

## Requirements
* Python 3
* A UNIX-like file system

The following sections of the README will serve as a quick start guide and basic documentation, as the program is relatively simple.

## Overview
In order to generate a website, four components are needed:

* Source files (these are the posts that will be inserted into the website)
* Templates written in HTML (A page template for how each page will look; a post template for how each post will look _within_ the page template; and a template for navigation buttons)
* A configuration file (contains paths to necessary files)
* The Python script

## Source files: Writing a post
Each source file represents one post on the generated website. They may contain metadata and body text. The following fields accept metadata when written in a source file (each on its own line):

* TITLE=[Your Title Here]
* DATE=[MM/DD/YYYY] [Hour:Minute] (The time field is optional and must be written in the 24-hour format)
* CATEGORIES=[category1,category2,category3]
* NUMBER=[x] (This field is optional. In it an integer can be entered. This integer will become associated with this source file and can be used for designating the order in which posts appear on the generated website. See section "The Python script" below.)

Body text is written as:
```
(START)
[Body Text]
(STOP)
```

Note that (START) and (STOP) must be written on their own lines. The body text should also start on its own line.

Example source files are included in the "doc" directory.

## Templates
The template files are regular HTML files. Certain keywords written in these templates will be replaced by content upon running the script. (For example, a keyword that represents a single post will be replaced with a single post.)

Examples of these templates have been included in the "doc" directory.

### Page template
This template represents a page on the generated website. Each page that is generated by the script will use this file as its template.

Keywords that may be entered in this file's \<body\> are:

* (POST) - Gets replaced with a single post.
* (NAVIGATION) - Gets replaced with navigation buttons for moving between pages.

**Tip:** For classic style webcomic sites, configure the page template to only display one post per page. This is done by writing only one (POST) on the page template.

### Post template
This is what (POST) on the page template will be replaced with. For this reason, you may want to have it contain only one <div> with class="post".

Keywords that may be entered in this file are:

* (NUMBER) - Replaced with the post number. By default, the first post displayed on the site is treated as the final post and assigned the highest post number (unless the reverse option -r is used. See section "The Python script" below.) (Note that this is not necessarily the same number as the metadata number mentioned above. Also see section "The Python script" below.)
* (TITLE) - The title that was assigned to a post in its source file
* (DATE) - The date that was assigned to a post in its source file
* (CATEGORIES) - The categories that were assigned to a post in its source file
* (BODY) - The post's body.

**Tip:** Place id="(NUMBER)" in the post template's main <div>. This way a URL to a specific post can be shared with: https://www.website.com/[page].html#[number]

### Navigation template

[Insert information about navigation template here...]

The template system allows users a fair amount of autonomy in how their websites will be designed. For example, keywords can be rearranged; surrounded in HTML tags like \<em\>; surrounded in a \<div\> or \<span\> which is then targeted by CSS.

## The configuration file

The configuration file is where paths of relevant files and directories are specified. The file should look like this:

```
[Paths]
OutputDirectory = [path/to/output_directory]
SourceDirectory = [path/to/source_files_directory]
PageTemplate = [path/to/page_template.html]
PostTemplate = [path/to/post_template.html]
NavigationTemplate = [path/to/navigation_template.html]
```

Note that paths are not put in quotes.
Relative paths may be used. They will be interpreted relative to the location of the configuration file.

Explanation:

* OutputDirectory - Where the generated site pages will be output.

**Tip:** If you are running this script on a web server, consider setting OutputDirectory to the directory where your website will be hosted. If your site is hosted on GitHub, consider setting OutputDirectory to a directory that is initialized with git, so you can simply run
	git push
to upload any changes to your site.

* SourceDirectory - All source files must be contained within a directory. That directory should not contain files other than source files (.swp files will be ignored, so users of text editors like Vim need not be concerned about swap files causing issues). It is possible to place the source files within subdirectories (for example, to facilitate better organization of files), as the SourceDirectory will be traversed recursively. Symlinks placed inside the SourceDirectory will be ignored.
* Template files - See previous section.

By default the Python script will search for the configuration file named "config.ini" in the same directory as where the script is located. 

### Manually specifying the path to a configuration file

The user can also use a command line option when running the script to specify the location of the configuration file. The syntax for this command line option is:
```
	python3 generator.py -c "path/to/config"
	python3 generator.py --config="path/to/config"
```
**Tip:** If you would like to use this static site generator for creating multiple websites, simply create multiple versions of the configuration file, each with its own unique values for OutputDirectory, SourceDirectory, PageTemplate, PostTemplate, and NavigationTemplate. Then run the generator using the command line option for specifying a configuration file.

The configuration file that comes bundled with this software uses paths to example source files and example templates. You can test that the program is working properly using these configuration file values. Afterwards, edit the configuration file to your preferences.

## The Python script

Upon running the script, all source files will be sorted and then inserted into HTML pages. By default posts will be sorted by date from newest to oldest. This provides the usual behavior of a blog: new posts are displayed at the top of the site's front page.

This order can be reversed (and become oldest to newest) using a command line option:
```
python3 generator.py -r
python3 generator.py --reverse (or --reversed)
```

The user can also use command line arguments to sort posts by title (the value passed to the TITLE= field in a source file), metadata number (the value passed to the optional NUMBER= field in a source file), and source file filename:

**Sort by post title** 
```
python3 generator.py -t
python3 generator.py --sort-by-title
```

**Sort by post metadata number** 
```
python3 generator.py -n
python3 generator.py --sort-by-number
```
The NUMBER= field in source files is completely optional. Its only purpose is providing manual control over how posts are sorted, and this requires the -n command line option to be used.

**Sort by filename** 
```
python3 generator.py -f
python3 generator.py --sort-by-filename
```

The other command line option that is available is [-c for manually specifying the path to a configuration file](###manually-specifying-the-path-to-a-configuration-file)
